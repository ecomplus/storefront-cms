We're hoping that Static CMS will do for the [Jamstack](https://www.jamstack.org) what WordPress did for dynamic sites back in the day. We know we can't do that without building a thriving community of contributors and users, and we'd love to have you join us.

## Getting started with contributing
Being a developer is not a requirement for contributing to Static CMS, you only need the desire, a web browser, and a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join). The GitHub repo has a step-by-step [guide](https://github.com/StaticJsCMS/static-cms/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started with the code.

## The basics of the Static CMS docs
The documentation for Static CMS is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (a good cheatsheet on Markdown is [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)), with the source residing on [GitHub](https://github.com/StaticJsCMS/static-cms) in the `/packages/docs/content/docs` folder.

The GitHub website allows you to submit issues, work with files, search for content, and browse changes that have been submitted in the past and those that are being submitted now (aka Pull Requests).

## Style guidelines
A [style guide](/docs/writing-style-guide/) is available to help provide context around grammar, code styling, syntax, etc.

## Filing issues
If you have a GitHub account, you can file an [issue](https://github.com/StaticJsCMS/static-cms/issues) (aka bug report) against the Static CMS docs. Even if you're not able to, or don't know how to, fix the issue (see [Improve existing content](#improve-existing-content)), it helps to start the conversation.

When filing an issue, it is important to remember the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/StaticJsCMS/static-cms/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Improve existing content
If you are able to offer up a change to existing content, it is welcome. Once you've forked the repo, and changed the content, you would file a pull request (PR). The repo [Contributing file](https://github.com/StaticJsCMS/static-cms/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) lays out the correct format for PRs.

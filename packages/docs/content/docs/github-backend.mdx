- **Name**: `github`

For repositories stored on GitHub, the `github` backend allows CMS users to log in directly with their GitHub account. Note that all users must have push access to your content repository for this to work.

## Authentication

Because Github requires a server for authentication, Netlify facilitates basic GitHub authentication.

To enable basic GitHub authentication:

1. Follow the authentication provider setup steps in the [Netlify docs](https://www.netlify.com/docs/authentication-providers/#using-an-authentication-provider).
2. Add the following lines to your Static CMS `config` file:

<CodeTabs>
```yaml
backend:
  name: github
  repo: owner-name/repo-name # Path to your GitHub repository
  # optional, defaults to main
  # branch: main
```

```js
backend: {
  name: 'github',
  repo: 'owner-name/repo-name', // Path to your GitHub repository
  // optional, defaults to main
  // branch: 'main'
},
```

</CodeTabs>

## Git Large File Storage (LFS)

Please note that the GitHub backend **does not** support [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

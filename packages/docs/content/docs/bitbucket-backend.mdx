- **Name**: `bitbucket`

For repositories stored on Bitbucket, the `bitbucket` backend allows CMS users to log in directly with their Bitbucket account. Note that all users must have write access to your content repository for this to work.

## Authentication

To enable Bitbucket authentication it:

1. Follow the authentication provider setup steps in the [Netlify docs](https://www.netlify.com/docs/authentication-providers/#using-an-authentication-provider).
2. Add the following lines to your Static CMS `config` file:

<CodeTabs>
```yaml
backend:
  name: bitbucket
  repo: owner-name/repo-name # Path to your Bitbucket repository
```

```js
backend: {
  name: 'bitbucket',
  repo: 'owner-name/repo-name', // Path to your Bitbucket repository
},
```
</CodeTabs>

Static CMS is a fork of [Decap](https://github.com/decaporg/decap-cms) (previously Netlify CMS) . Many changes have been made, some big, some small.

In this guide, we will walk you through the steps of migrating from Decap to Static CMS.

## How to Migrate

Start by replacing Decap with Static CMS, then address the changes below.

### CDN

Decap:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/netlify-cms@^2.0.0/dist/netlify-cms.js"></script>
```

Static CMS:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@staticcms/app@^2.0.0/dist/static-cms-app.js"></script>
```

### Bundling

```bash
# Uninstall Decap
npm uninstall netlify-cms-app
npm uninstall netlify-cms-core

# Install Static CMS
npm install @staticcms/core
```

#### Change your imports

Decap:

```js
import CMS from 'netlify-cms-app';
```

Static CMS:

```js
import CMS from '@staticcms/core';
```

## Changes

### React 18

React `18.2.0` is now the minimum supported React version. If you are using Static CMS through a CDN, this comes bundled.

### Static CMS Styles

Static CMS bundles it styles separately from the main javascript file, so you will need to import them separately.

**CDN**:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@staticcms/app@^2.0.0/dist/main.css" />
```

**Bundling**:

```js
import '@staticcms/core/dist/main.css';
```

### Backends

The Azure backend has been remove. All other backends are still supported.

However, the Gitlab, Client-Side Implicit Grant has been removed as a method of authentication.

### Dates

[Moment](https://momentjs.com/) has been dropped as the date library used. Instead we are now using [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/). Date formats in your configuration will need to be updated. See [format docs](https://date-fns.org/v2.29.3/docs/format).

### Initializing Static CMS

CMS must be explicitly initiated by calling `CMS.init()`. Passing a config to `CMS.init()` will now completely override `config.yml` (they are now exclusive), instead of being merged with `config.yml`

### Markdown Editor

A [new markdown editor](/docs/widget-markdown) has been added. It comes with a new [shortcode](/docs/widget-markdown#shortcodes) system, old editor components no longer work.

### Sortable Fields

The `sortable_fields` configuration option has been slightly changed, as we now allow a [default sorting option](/docs/collection-overview#sortable_fields).

**Decap**:

```yaml
sortable_fields: - field1 - field2
```

**Static CMS**:

```yaml
sortable_fields: fields: - field1 - field2
```

### List Widget

Support in the List Widget for the `field` property has been dropped. A single field in the `fields` property [achieves the same behavior](/docs/widget-list).

### Custom Widgets

Custom widget creation has changed. `createClass` has been removed. Custom widgets should all be [functional components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components) now.

There have also been changes to how custom widgets are registered and the properties passed to the controls and previews. See [custom widgets](/docs/custom-widgets) for full details.

### Custom Previews

Custom preview creation has changed. `createClass` has been removed. Custom previews should all be [functional components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components) now.

There have also been changes to the properties passed to custom previews. See [custom previews](/docs/custom-previews) for full details.

### External integrations

The following external integrations have been removed:

- Algolia
- AssetStore
- Cloudinary
- Uploadcare

### Deprecated Features

- All deprecated features were removed
  - `date` widget has been removed
  - `datetime` widget
    - `dateFormat` has been removed (Use `date_format` instead)
    - `timeFormat` has been removed (Use `time_format` instead)

### Media Library

The `getAsset` method has been removed, the new `useMediaAsset` hook should be used instead. See [Interacting With The Media Library](/docs/custom-widgets#interacting-with-the-media-library).

### Beta Features

The following beta features from Decap have been dropped:

- GraphQL support for GitHub and GitLab
- Remark plugins (new markdown editor has its own plugin system)
- Dynamic Default Values
- Custom Mount Element

#### Nested Collections

[Nested Collections](/docs/collection-types#nested-collections) have some breaking config changes. The `meta` config has been dropped and its `path` property has been moved into the `nested` prop. You can also no longer specify the widget type for the path.

**Old Config**

<CodeTabs>
```yaml
collections:
  - name: pages
    label: Pages
    label_singular: 'Page'
    folder: content/pages
    create: true
    nested:
      depth: 100
      summary: '{{title}}'
    fields:
      - label: Title
        name: title
        widget: string
      - label: Body
        name: body
        widget: markdown
    meta: { path: { widget: string, label: 'Path', index_file: 'index' } }
```

```js
{
  collections: [
    {
      name: 'pages',
      label: 'Pages',
      label_singular: 'Page',
      folder: 'content/pages',
      create: true,
      nested: {
        depth: 100,
        summary: '{{title}}',
      },
      fields: [
        {
          label: 'Title',
          name: 'title',
          widget: 'string',
        },
        {
          label: 'Body',
          name: 'body',
          widget: 'markdown',
        },
      ],
      meta: {
        path: {
          widget: 'string',
          label: 'Path',
          index_file: 'index',
        },
      },
    },
  ];
}
```

</CodeTabs>

## Platform Changes

### Gatsby

If you are using Gatsby you will need to change out your CMS plugin.

```bash
# Uninstall Decap plugin
npm uninstall gatsby-plugin-netlify-cms

# Install Static CMS plugin
npm install gatsby-plugin-static-cms
```

## Local Development Changes

If you are using the local backend you will need to switch the proxy server package you are using.

Decap:

```bash
npx netlify-cms-proxy-server
```

Static CMS:

```bash
npx @staticcms/proxy-server
```

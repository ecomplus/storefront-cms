You can adapt Static CMS to a wide variety of projects. It works with any content written in markdown, JSON or YAML files, stored in a repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org). You can also create your own custom backend.

You can add Static CMS to your site in two different ways:

## CDN hosting

Adding Static CMS via a public CDN to a site that's built with a common static site generator, like Jekyll, Hugo, Hexo, or Gatsby. Alternatively, is a quick and easy way to get started. You can start from a [template](/docs/start-with-a-template) or use [this guide](/docs/add-to-your-site-cdn) to get started.

## Bundling

An alternative to CDN is directly bundling the StaticCMS package directly into your app. While this require extra setup steps, it give you the greatest level of control over your CMS. It also provides complete support for TypeScript, including for your config file.

See [the bundling guide](/docs/add-to-your-site-bundling) to get started.

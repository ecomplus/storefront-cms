weight: 101
---

Static CMS v2 introduces a brand new UI and an updated media library.

In this guide, we will walk you through the steps for upgrading to Static CMS v2.

Please [report any issues](https://github.com/StaticJsCMS/static-cms/issues/new) you encounter while upgrading to Static CMS v2.

## Installing

To install the latest version of Static CMS:

```bash
npm install @staticcms/core@^2.0.0
```

Or if youâ€™re using yarn:

```bash
yarn add @staticcms/core@^2.0.0
```

If you are using a CDN to load Static CMS, simply change your URL:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@staticcms/app@^2.0.0/dist/static-cms-app.js"></script>
```

### Proxy Server

If you are using `@staticcms/proxy-server` you will need to ensure you are using version `3.0.0` or above for all features in Static CMS `v2.0.0` to work.

## Deprecated Items Removed

All previously deprecated items have been removed as part of this release.

- `getAsset` - Use `useMediaAsset` React hook instead
- `createReactClass` - Use [react functional components](https://react.dev/learn) instead
- `isFieldDuplicate` - Use `duplicate` variable instead
- `isFieldHidden` - Use `hidden` variable instead

## Importing Static CMS Styles

In `v2.0.0` the apps stylings are not longer bundled into the main javscript file. For both CDN and bundled setups, you will need to include the css file yourself.

**CDN**:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@staticcms/app@^2.0.0/dist/main.css" />
```

**Bundling**:

```js
import '@staticcms/core/dist/main.css';
```

### Custom Preview Styles

Some basic preview styles are now provided in order to properly support dark mode and make the basic previews look a bit better. However, if you [provide your own preview styles](/docs/custom-previews#editor-preview-styles) these default styles will not be included in the preview.

## Nested Collections

While still in beta, [Nested Collections](/docs/collection-types#nested-collections) are now fully working and supported in `v2.0.0`. However there are some breaking config changes. The `meta` config has been dropped and its `path` property has been moved into the `nested` prop. You can also no longer specify the widget type for the path.

**Old Config**

<CodeTabs>
```yaml
collections:
  - name: pages
    label: Pages
    label_singular: 'Page'
    folder: content/pages
    create: true
    nested:
      depth: 100
      summary: '{{title}}'
    fields:
      - label: Title
        name: title
        widget: string
      - label: Body
        name: body
        widget: markdown
    meta: { path: { widget: string, label: 'Path', index_file: 'index' } }
```

```js
{
  collections: [
    {
      name: 'pages',
      label: 'Pages',
      label_singular: 'Page',
      folder: 'content/pages',
      create: true,
      nested: {
        depth: 100,
        summary: '{{title}}',
      },
      fields: [
        {
          label: 'Title',
          name: 'title',
          widget: 'string',
        },
        {
          label: 'Body',
          name: 'body',
          widget: 'markdown',
        },
      ],
      meta: {
        path: {
          widget: 'string',
          label: 'Path',
          index_file: 'index',
        },
      },
    },
  ];
}
```

</CodeTabs>

**New Config**

<CodeTabs>
```yaml
collections:
  - name: pages
    label: Pages
    label_singular: 'Page'
    folder: content/pages
    create: true
    nested:
      depth: 100
      summary: '{{title}}'
      path: { label: 'Path', index_file: 'index' }
    fields:
      - label: Title
        name: title
        widget: string
      - label: Body
        name: body
        widget: markdown
```

```js
{
  collections: [
    {
      name: 'pages',
      label: 'Pages',
      label_singular: 'Page',
      folder: 'content/pages',
      create: true,
      nested: {
        depth: 100,
        summary: '{{title}}',
        path: {
          label: 'Path',
          index_file: 'index',
        },
      },
      fields: [
        {
          label: 'Title',
          name: 'title',
          widget: 'string',
        },
        {
          label: 'Body',
          name: 'body',
          widget: 'markdown',
        },
      ],
    },
  ];
}
```

</CodeTabs>

## External Media Libraries

External media integrations for Cloudinary and Uploadcare have been removed as part of an ongoing to effect to narrow the focus of Static CMS. With [Decap](https://decapcms.org/) (previously Netlify CMS) being supported again its not as critical for Static CMS to support every possible option. So, in order to focus our efforts on other features, it has been decided to remove these external media integrations.

[Netlify Large Media](/docs/netlify-large-media) is still available.

This brings with it some breaking changes for the `media_library` config property.

**Old Config (for Image or File Field)**

<CodeTabs>
```yaml
name: thumbnail
label: Featured Image
widget: image
default: /uploads/chocolate-dogecoin.jpg
media_library:
  choose_url: true
  config:
    max_file_size: 512000
```

```js
{
  name: "thumbnail",
  label: "Featured Image",
  widget: "image",
  default: "/uploads/chocolate-dogecoin.jpg",
  media_library: {
    choose_url: true,
    config: {
      max_file_size: 512000
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeTabs>

**New Config**

<CodeTabs>
```yaml
name: thumbnail
label: Featured Image
widget: image
default: /uploads/chocolate-dogecoin.jpg
choose_url: true
media_library:
  max_file_size: 512000
```

```js
{
  name: "thumbnail",
  label: "Featured Image",
  widget: "image",
  default: "/uploads/chocolate-dogecoin.jpg",
  choose_url: true,
  media_library: {
    max_file_size: 512000
  }
}
```

</CodeTabs>

Also the `clearMediaControl` and `removeMediaControl` widget control props have been removed as they were only used for the external media library integrations.

## Other Breaking Changes

- [Card previews](/docs/custom-previews#collection-card-preview) now are only used for the card view. The `viewStyle` property has been removed. [Field previews](/docs/custom-previews#field-preview) can be used to change the table view.
- Widget Control component property changes:
  - `isDisabled` renamed to `disabled`
  - `isDuplicate` renamed to `duplicate`
  - `isHidden` renamed to `hidden`
  - `mediaPaths` is now object of id mapped to an object containing the `path` and optional `alt`
- `useMediaInsert` hook now requires a collection to be passed in. Its callback function now receives an object containing the `path` and optional `alt` instead of a string.
- `prePublish` and `postPublish` events have been dropped.

## Other Changes

- `summary_fields` property added to [collection configuration](/docs/collection-overview) to allow customization of the table view. This works with the new [field preview](/docs/custom-previews).
- New widget control property: `forSingleList`. It specifies if the widget is within a singleton `list` widget (string array, number array, etc)

## Deprecations

In the Widget Control component property, the following properties have been deprecated. They will be removed in `v3.0.0`.

| Param               | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| mediaPaths          | object   | <Deprecated>Use [useMediaInsert](/docs/custom-widgets#interacting-with-the-media-library) instead.</Deprecated> Key/value object of control IDs (passed to the media library) mapping to media paths |
| openMediaLibrary    | function | <Deprecated>Use [useMediaInsert](/docs/custom-widgets#interacting-with-the-media-library) instead.</Deprecated> Opens the media library popup. See [Open Media Library](#open-media-library)         |
| removeInsertedMedia | function | <Deprecated>Use [useMediaInsert](/docs/custom-widgets#interacting-with-the-media-library) instead.</Deprecated> Removes draft media for a give control ID                                            |

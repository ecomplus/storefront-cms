You can add Static CMS [to an existing site](/docs/add-to-your-site/), but the quickest way to get started is with a template. Found below, our featured templates deploy a bare-bones site and Static CMS to Netlify, giving you a fully working CMS-enabled site with just a few clicks.

<Templates>
  <Template
    title="Hugo Site Starter"
    image="/img/hugo.svg"
    url="https://github.com/StaticJsCMS/static-cms-hugo-netlify-template"
  />
  <Template
    title="Gatsby Site Starter"
    image="/img/gatsby.svg"
    url="https://github.com/StaticJsCMS/static-cms-gatsby-netlify-template"
  />
  <Template
    title="Preact CLI"

  <Template

  />
  <Template
    title="Eleventy Starter"
    image="/img/11ty-logo.svg"

</Templates>

After clicking one of those buttons, authenticate with GitHub and choose a repository name. Netlify then automatically creates a clone of the repository in your GitHub account. Next, it builds and deploys the new site on Netlify, bringing you to the site dashboard after completing the build.

**Note for GitLab and Bitbucket users:** Static CMS supports GitLab and Bitbucket repositories, but won't work with the Deploy to Netlify buttons above without additional configuration (See [GitLab](/docs/gitlab-backend) or [Bitbucket](/docs/bitbucket-backend) respectively).

## Access Static CMS

1. The template deploy process sends you an invitation to your new site, sent from `no-reply@netlify.com`.
   ![Sample email subject line: You've been invited to join radiologist-amanda-53841.netlify.com](/img/email-subject.webp)
2. Wait for the deployment to complete, then click the link to accept the invite. Your site will open with a prompt to create a password.

3. Enter a password, sign in, and you'll go to Static CMS. (For future visits, you can go straight to `<yoursiteaddress.com>/admin/`.)

Try adding and editing posts, or changing the content of the Products page. When you save, the changes are pushed immediately to your Git repository, triggering a build on Netlify, and updating the content on your site. Check out the configuration code by visiting your site repo.
